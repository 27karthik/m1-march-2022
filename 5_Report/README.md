The Departmental Store Management System is a console-based application built using c language which does not use graphic. This application can be used in any departmental store where you can add the goods, edit goods,search, delete, and also display the data of goods.

This project also uses the method of file handling where you can store all the goods data like rate, product name and price in a specific file. The data is stored in the file so you can display the data stored in that file anytime.

In this project void gotoxy(int x, int y) is used. This function allows the user to print text in any place of the screen.
